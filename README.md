# C.A.T.S. - Cutting-edge Adaptive Technology Stack
CATS is an innovative technology stack that aims to provide cutting-edge adaptation capabilities for various rendering and post-processing tasks in the field of computer graphics for Unity Universal Render Pipeline. CATS contains four sub-projects: Radiant, Nanoframe, Cosmos, Pulse.

### Current Status:
It's not clear how radiant, nanoframe, and cosmos will be at the moment, but Pulse is in the work.

## Radiant - Real-time Adaptive Display and Illumination Toolkit
Radiant is a powerful light engine similar to Unreal Engine's Lumen. It focuses on real-time global illumination techniques to enhance the realism and visual quality of rendered scenes. By utilizing advanced algorithms and optimizations, Radiant aims to provide efficient and accurate lighting calculations for dynamic scenes.

## Nanoframe - Nanostructured Adaptive Mesh Optimization Framework
Nanoframe is a revolutionary technology similar to Unreal Engine's Nanite. It aims to tackle the challenge of rendering massive amounts of geometric detail efficiently. Nanoframe utilizes advanced algorithms and data structures to enable real-time rendering of highly detailed meshes without sacrificing performance. With Nanoframe, developers can create incredibly detailed environments and models, pushing the boundaries of visual fidelity in real-time graphics.

## Cosmos - Creative Optimization System for Modular Output Generation
Cosmos is a flexible and versatile framework inspired by Blender's Geometry Nodes. It provides a node-based system for procedural generation and manipulation of 3D geometry. With Cosmos, developers can create complex procedural workflows to generate, modify, and animate geometry in a visual and intuitive manner. It empowers artists and developers to create dynamic and customizable assets, simulations, and effects with ease.

## [Pulse - Post-Processing Utilities, LUTs, and Special Effects](https://github.com/Warwlock/PULSE)
Pulse is a comprehensive post-processing pipeline designed to enhance the visual quality of rendered images. It offers a wide range of customizable effects and filters to apply to the final rendered frames. Pulse enables developers to add depth of field, motion blur, color grading, tone mapping, and many other post-processing effects to achieve the desired aesthetic for their projects. Also you can create you custom post-processing effects with shaders.

Pulse contains those effects (More can be added later...): FSR 2.0, Color Adjustment, Tone Mapping, Depth of Field, Bloom, Chromatic Aberration, Film Grain, Lens Distortion, Motion Blur, Vignette, White Balance

To see the full progress of Pulse, you can go to its own repository.

# NOTE:
I am developing this project in my spare time, so it is progressing very slowly and I certainly do not know whether this project will be completed or not because it's harder than I thought.
